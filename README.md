# Decoing EEG from Passive Viewing

This repository contains the code to run a passive viewing task to be used in conjuction with actiHamp EEG acquistion to test data decoding (see stim folder). Additionally, simple code for the analysis of the acquired EEG data is also made available (anal). The code was written by members of MSU NPAL lab in 2020 and runs on MATLAB R2015 with MGL.
